    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Much quicker than the usual recipes, these loaves of whole wheat bread can be ready to eat in a little over an hour. Easy, quick and delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups warm water (110 to 120 degrees F)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, instant yeast, and salt together in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Whisk water and oil together in a cup; pour into flour mixture. Mix on low speed until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl into a ball.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead just until dough is smooth, about 1 minute. Divide and shape dough into 3 balls for small loaves or 2 balls for larger loaves. Dust loaves with flour and place onto a baking sheet; cover with a towel, and let rise until doubled in size, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Slash an "X" about 1/4-inch deep in tops of loaves with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
